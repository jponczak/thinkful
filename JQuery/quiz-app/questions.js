        question: "On New Year's Day, NASA's nuclear-powered spacecraft flew past a mysterious, mountain-sized object 4 billion miles from Earth. What is the name of the space craft?",
        answer: "New Horizon",
        description: "The object, called MU69, is nicknamed Arrokoth, which means \"sky\" in the Powhatan/Algonquian language (it was previously nicknamed Ultima Thule). It's the most distant object humanity has ever visited.",

        question: "Which planet was discovered to have quakes like Earth?",
        answer: "Mars",
        description: "NASA's InSight lander, which touched down on Mars in November 2018, has given scientists the unprecedented ability to detect and monitor Mars quakes.The lander\'s built-in seismometer detected its first Mars quake in April. Since then, researchers have recorded more than 100 seismic events, about 21 of which were likely quakes. Reading the seismic waves on Mars, scientists hope, will reveal clues about what the planet\'s inside looks like. ",

        question: "In July 2019, a Japanese spacecraft landed on an asteriod 5.5 million miles away from Earth. How long did it take to travel there?",
        answer: "About 3.5 years",
        description: "In order to collect samples from deep within the space rock, Hayabusa-2 blasted a hole in the asteroid before landing. The mission plan calls for it to bring those samples back to Earth. By studying Ryugu's innermost rocks and debris — which have been sheltered from the wear and tear of space — scientists hope to learn how asteroids like this may have seeded Earth with key ingredients for life billions of years ago.",

        question: "In April 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope team published the first ever image of what?",
        answer: "A black hole",
        description: "Scientists struggled for decades to capture a black hole on camera, since black holes distort space-time, ensuring that nothing can break free of their gravitational pull — even light. That's why the image shows a unique shadow in the form of a perfect circle at the center.",

        question: "Based on satellite imagery, researchers estimate that the world's oceans could rise by how many feet by 2100?",
        answer: "3",
        description: "A September report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected that sea levels could rise by more than 3 feet by the end of the century. The rising water could affect hundreds of millions of people who live on small islands and in coastal regions.",
